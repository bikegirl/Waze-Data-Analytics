Waze is a free navigational app that makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go.  Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible drive more safely and efficiently.  This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict user churn.  Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app.  This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth.  High retention rate indicates satisfied users who repeatedly use the app and an accurate model can also help identify factors that contribute to church.
